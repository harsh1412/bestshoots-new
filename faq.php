            <h3>What does the price include?</h3>
            <p class="last">All the facilities listed under the room type are included in the room price. To see the
                facilities, just click on the room name. You can see if breakfast or anything else, such as taxes, are
                included by rolling your cursor over the text in the column called ‘Conditions’. This information will
                also be in your confirmation email, and can be found in your account when you sign in. If you don’t have
                an account, you can create one here.</p>
            <h3>Can I make a reservation without a credit card?</h3>
            <p class="last">A valid credit card is needed to guarantee your reservation with most hotels. We do offer a
                small but growing number of hotels, however, that will guarantee your reservation without a credit card.
                You can also make a booking using someone else’s card provided you have their permission. In this case
                please confirm the card holder’s name and that you have permission to use their card, in the ‘Special
                Requests’ box when making your booking.</p>
            <h3>What does the price include?</h3>
            <p class="last">All the facilities listed under the room type are included in the room price. To see the
                facilities, just click on the room name. You can see if breakfast or anything else, such as taxes, are
                included by rolling your cursor over the text in the column called ‘Conditions’. This information will
                also be in your confirmation email, and can be found in your account when you sign in. If you don’t have
                an account, you can create one here.</p>
            <h3>How do I know my reservation is confirmed?</h3>
            <p>If you have a question for a property before you book, please see the information under the policies and
                facilities of that property on our website. If you do not find your answer there, please contact
                Customer Service by phone or email, and we will be happy to ask on your behalf.</p>
            <p class="last">Once you have booked, you can see the property’s contact details in your online booking
                confirmation. Your confirmation email will also have this information, and you can see it in under
                Manage Booking as well. The Booking.com mobile app also includes this information.</p>
